# redo on Microsoft Windows

Support for Microsoft Windows is experimental.
It is generally usable, but lacks some features that are available on Unix-like
operating systems:

- Parallel builds (`-j` command line switch) are not supported
- `redoconf` is not supported

## Prerequisites

### Using redo

- python2

### Building redo

Shell, python.

E.g. msys2:

pacman -S msys/python2
